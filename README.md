SIMCA mCP

version 1: July 2023

ABOUT SIMCA mCP:

This repository contains data and Matlab scripts to facilitate the implementation of 
a DD-SIMCA model for the acceptance testing of purified m-cresol purple (mCP) for spectrophotometric pH measurements
in seawater. The model was trained on measurements of UV-visible absorbance spectra of purified mCP and tested on
independent datasets consisting of purified and unpurified mCP samples. The repository contains demo scripts that will demonstrate
the training and optimization of the DD-SIMCA model and reproduce the figures in the associated publication (see citation below). 
A function is provided for users to classify new mCP samples with the model. 

You may cite the use of the data as follows:

spectra of purified and unpurified m-cresol purple samples in sodium hydroxide

Project Status: Maintenance only 

Testing Summary

The demo scripts have been tested to ensure that they can be run in Matlab R2019b and Matlab R2022a with only 
the provided functions, data files, and PLS Toolbox version 8.9.2 (Eigenvector Research) and that they reproduce
the figures in the associated manuscript.

Getting Started

Download the repository SIMCA mCP and add the main repository as well as all subfolders 
to MATLAB's search path. 

Run either of the m-files in the \demo folder to verify that the scripts work. 

Demo_OptimizeSIMCAModel.m will illustrate the training and optimization of the DD-SIMCA Model
and generate Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 from the manuscript.

Demo_ClassifyNewmCPSamples provides an example of classifying new mCP samples with the optimized model and generates Fig. 5
from the manuscript. This demo requires PLS Toolbox to perform the instrument standardization.

The demo scripts use the data contained in the folder \data.

New samples measured by the user can be classified with the SIMCA model by calling:

	NewClass = ClassifymCPSamples(class_labels, A_samples)		

The inputs are class_labels, a cell array of sample names, and A_samples, a matrix containing the spectra of the samples.
This function loads the optimized SIMCA model saved in mCP SIMCA Model\NIST_mCP_SIMCAModel.mat and calls DDSTask to classify the new samples

Prerequisites

Requires MATLAB and PLS Toolbox.
